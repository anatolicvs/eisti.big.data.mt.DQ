Digital data play a crucial role in the information and communication technology (ICT) society: they are managed by business and govermental applications, by all kind of applications on the Web, and are 
fundamental in all relationships between goverments, business, and citizens. 

Furthermore, quality of data is also a significant ussue for operational process of business and organizations. Some disasters are due to the presence of data quality problems, among them the use 
of inaccurate, incomplete, out-of-data. 

As a consequence, the overall quality of the information that flows between information systems may rapidly degrade over time if both process and their inputs are not themselves subject to quality 
control. ON the other hand, the same networked information system offers new opportunites for data quality management, including possibility of selectingsources with better quality data, and of comparing sources for
the purpose of error localization and correction, thus facilitating the control and improvement of data quality in the system.

Due to the described above motivations, researchers and organizations more and more need to understand and solve data quality problems, and thus answering the following questions: 
What is in essence, data quality? Which teqniques, methodologies, and data quality issues are at a consolidated stage?

In this paper, we first review relevant works and discuss machine learning techniques, tools and statistical models. Second, we offer a creative data profiling frework based deep learning 
and statistical model algortihms for improving data quality.
