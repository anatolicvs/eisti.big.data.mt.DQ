## Introduction

![Big Data Quality Evaluation Scheme](https://github.com/aytacozkan/eisti.big.data.mt.DQ/blob/master/Chapter3/Raster/big_data_quality_evaluation_scheme.png?raw=true)

Each and every industry has data quality issues, it has been a major challenge to choose the right method
to improve the data quality. Todayâ€™s machine learning / deep learning models helps us to improve the
data quality significantly. It is important to evaluate the best methods and approaches.

### Topic:
Improve data quality using Deep Learning (DL) or Machine Learning (ML) and evaluate the model
performance, accuracy. Use pipelines for data transformations and modeling. Identify all the possible
data quality issues in the dataset and solve it using DL/ML.

### Technologies: 

Cloudera/Hortonworks(either using VM, AWS, Dockers, Kubernetes etc...). PySpark/ Scikitlearn, machine learning, deep learning models (Convolutional neural network, Long short-term memory
(LSTM), Deep Residual Networks with Tensorflow or Keras to test and improve the data quality
